# MeshAgent Webmaster Operator

Use this skill for `meshagent webserver ...`, `meshagent route ...`, and live room-site deployment.

## Use this skill when

- The user wants to make, update, or deploy a site in the current room.
- The task involves `meshagent webserver ...` routes files, handlers, static assets, local join, spec generation, or deploy flows.
- The task involves `meshagent route ...` creation, inspection, update, or deletion.
- The task requires a public URL, hostname, domain, or route-backed exposure for a room website.

## Shared runtime

Use the room runtime defined in `../meshagent-cli-operator/SKILL.md`.

- Use the companion references in `../meshagent-cli-operator/references/command_groups.md` and `../meshagent-cli-operator/references/meshagent_cli_help.md` for exact command shapes and flags.

## Primary command groups

- `meshagent webserver check`
- `meshagent webserver init`
- `meshagent webserver add`
- `meshagent webserver join`
- `meshagent webserver spec`
- `meshagent webserver deploy`
- `meshagent route create`
- `meshagent route update`
- `meshagent route show`
- `meshagent route list`
- `meshagent route delete`

## Operating rules

- Treat a room-site request as complete only when the site is actually deployed in the current room and you can report the resulting public URL or the exact blocker.
- For website, route, and public hostname work, default to `*.__MESHAGENT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN__` hostnames unless the user explicitly asks for a different MeshAgent public domain.
- Create and modify site assets under `/data`.
- Do not stop at local file edits or a successful local `webserver check` when the requested outcome is a live room website.
- Prefer `meshagent webserver deploy` when the goal is a deployed room website. Use `meshagent route ...` directly only when route management is explicitly requested or when you need manual routing without `--domain`.
- Use `meshagent webserver check` before deploy when the routes file or asset mapping may be invalid.
- Use `meshagent webserver spec` when the user explicitly wants the generated service spec or when inspecting deployment shape before mutating.
- Use `meshagent webserver join` only for local runtime validation or debugging, not as the completion state for a room-site deployment request.
- When deploying, set `--room "${MESHAGENT_ROOM}"` unless the user explicitly asks for a different room-scoped target.
- When deploying, provide a real `--website-path` that matches the room storage subpath where the routes file and referenced assets should live.
- Prefer `--domain` on `meshagent webserver deploy` when the site should be publicly reachable and the route should follow the deploy.
- If using `meshagent route create` or `update` manually, verify the domain, room, and published port exactly before mutating.
- If a route already exists and targets a different room, stop and report that conflict instead of silently repointing it.
- Do not modify unrelated example apps, sample repos, bundled SDK examples, or maintainer reference projects to satisfy a room deployment request.
- After deploy or route mutation, verify the resulting service and route state with the corresponding read commands and report the live public URL.

## Default workflow

1. Resolve the room target, public hostname expectation, and desired site path.
2. Build or update the site assets under `/data`.
3. Validate the routes file with `meshagent webserver check`.
4. Deploy with `meshagent webserver deploy`, usually with `--room "${MESHAGENT_ROOM}"`, `--website-path`, and `--domain`.
5. Verify the resulting service and route state.
6. Return the exact public URL, or the exact remaining blocker if the site is not actually reachable yet.

## Command-specific guidance

### Webserver routes files

- `meshagent webserver init` creates a scaffold when no routes file exists.
- `meshagent webserver add` is the fastest way to add a static or python route entry.
- Route paths must start with `/`.
- `python` and `static` sources without a leading `/` resolve relative to the routes file.
- For Python handlers, use the supported handler signature documented by the CLI help: `handler(*, room: RoomClient, req: web.Request) -> web.StreamResponse`.

### Webserver deploy

- Prefer `meshagent webserver deploy` for room-site deployment.
- Use `--website-path` consistently so the deployed container can resolve the routes file and referenced assets.
- Use `--domain` when you want deploy to create or update the route automatically.
- If the request is specifically about a public website, do not call the task complete until deploy and route verification are done.

### Route management

- Use `meshagent route list` or `show` before `create`, `update`, or `delete`.
- Default to hostnames under `__MESHAGENT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN__` unless the user asks otherwise.
- Treat route `update` and `delete` as destructive.
- Re-run a read command after any mutation to confirm the final room and port target.

## Out of scope

- Do not use this skill for mailbox, inbox, or MailBot workflows; use `meshagent-mail-operator` for those.
- Do not use this skill for scheduled-task workflows; use `meshagent-scheduling-operator` for those.
- Do not use this skill for generic room runtime work that is not about sites, routes, or public web exposure; use `meshagent-cli-operator` for that.
