argument-hint: "<goal, room, service, project, or meshagent command>"

# /meshagent

Use this command for any request that involves the MeshAgent CLI.

## Workflow

1. Start with [SKILL.md](../skills/meshagent-cli-operator/SKILL.md).
2. Use [SKILL.md](../skills/meshagent-mail-operator/SKILL.md) for contact forms, email delivery, mailboxes, inbox evidence, or MailBot toolkits.
3. Use [SKILL.md](../skills/meshagent-scheduling-operator/SKILL.md) for scheduled tasks, cron-based dispatch, or queue scheduling.
4. Use [SKILL.md](../skills/meshagent-webmaster-operator/SKILL.md) for websites, webservers, routes, domains, or public URL exposure.
5. Pick the narrowest MeshAgent command path that fits the request.
6. If flags or subcommands are unclear, check [meshagent_cli_help.md](../skills/meshagent-cli-operator/references/meshagent_cli_help.md) or run `meshagent <path> --help`.
7. Prefer inspection before mutation.
8. After any change, verify with the corresponding `show`, `list`, or read command.
